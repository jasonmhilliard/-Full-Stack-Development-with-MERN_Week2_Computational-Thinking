I. File list

movingObjectsInTheBrowser - HTML File

II. Concept
----------
This HTML file contains HTML code to create an object (a square) and Javascript in order to move the object around in the browser.

III. Future Improvements

Expansion of the HTML and JavaScript code to produce multiple objects all moving at the same time within the browser.

IV.  License
----------
The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.
