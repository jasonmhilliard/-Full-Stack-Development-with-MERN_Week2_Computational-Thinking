# Computational-Thinking
Week2: Computational Thinking

I. File list
------------
movingObjectsInTheBrowser - HTML File

II. Concept
----------
This HTML file contains HTML code to create an object (in this case a square) and Javascript code in order to define an area and move the object around in that specified area within the browser window.  To execute the code, all you have to do is drag and drop the HTML file into an empty browser window.

III. Future Improvements
----------
Expansion of the HTML and JavaScript code to produce multiple objects all moving at the same time within the browser.

IV.  License
----------
The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.
